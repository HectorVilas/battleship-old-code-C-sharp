# Battleship (old C# code)

A Battleship game I wrote in C# back in 2015 if I recall correct. No internet searchs for help, only the basics I learned from some video tutorials.

Playable in the console, it's pure ASCII (also it's in spanish). There's nothing interesting here, I just want to backup the code, in case I lose the file.

This is the "main menu", if you want to call it that.

And here is the board. The one with red frame is the enemy's, and the green one is the player. The boats only occupy one tile, it was hard to do alone, without even knowing what I was suposed to write in the internet search. I played a little, writing the X and Y coordinates to drop a bomb.

Another screenshot of the board with a different size. Here the player choses width and height of the board before starting playing, 20 max to prevent ridiculously big boards.

This is not the first time I wrote a battleship game, it's the third time, heh. The first one was on Codecademy on `Python`, but with too much handholding. The second one was in `C++` all by myself. The third one is this one, on `C#`, with a little more experience with 2D arrays.

This project was fun and really rewarding when everything works as espected. Without knowing what to do next, I abandoned again the programming learning, thinking I wasted my time again because I never knew what to do with this, but didn't know how valuable the experience was. No I can "think like a programmer" and any new language will be easier to learn (Did a little Ruby online course, It wasn't too hard for the basics).

Now I'm learning `JavaScript` from those free online courses (Odin Project, pretty good, zero handholding) and may try to make another Battleship for the fourth time, but this time I feel more prepared. I hope I can keep going with this, learning more and more, and adding more programming languages to my knowledge. This is fun, rewarding and I could get a good job in the future.
