# Battleship (old C# code)

A Battleship game I wrote in C# back in 2015 if I recall correct. No internet searchs for help, only the basics I learned from some video tutorials.

Playable in the console, it's pure ASCII (also it's in spanish). There's nothing interesting here, I just want to backup the code, in case I lose the file.
